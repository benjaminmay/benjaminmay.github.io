###### DATA Analysis


I will be analyzing  [a clinical trial comparing Ibuprofen-PC and ibuprofen on the GI safety and analgesic efficacy in osteoarthritic patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3353548/)


### Participant Analysis
To start off, the trial only consisted of 125 people, with a large variety of ages; Adult under the age of 83 could participate. However, the conditions whioch these constituents had to meet were strict. While this is good in removing other variables which could impact the results, it does reduce the amount of particpants readily available. 

1. They had to have osteoarthritis and require therapy. 
1. they could not have
   * many ulcer related things, like gastro-oesophageal reflux or any other diseases
   * NSAIDs (2 weeks)
   * pain meds (3 days)
   * gastroprotective meds (3 days) 
   * related health problem besides the one in question
   * some hypersensitivites


The data was taken from canidates who were well chosen, and it is unlikely for their to be other overarching factors that will majorly influence this study. However, as stated before, the anmount of particpants is rather low. But it is a necesary trade-off here. statistic, they recognize that  

### Scoring System Analysis

The most important data kept was the Lanza scores. It is based on the number of erosions and/ or an ulcer. An ulcer would have the highest number. Its quantatative data means that there will be very little interpretive data where it could be accidently biased or based on oppinion. The scoring system is as follows

0 is normal stomach
1 is mucosal hemorrhages
2 is 1-2 erosions
3 is 3-10 erosions
4 is 10+ or an ulcer.

The problem with this tracking system is that having 10 erosions is very different than having 3, but the results are stil the same in the study. However, there is a bigger difference between 3 v 2 erosions, than 3 v 4, so a system like this is necesary. However, I do belive that it can slighlty misrepresent whats actually happening in the study, but not drasticlly. I belive that more scores on the index could theoretically be helpful. 

There were also sceondary data types that they were keeping track of, even though they werent the main one. This is pretty standard practice. It does not at all effect the main data, or question its reliability.



### Results Analysis

I trust their results for their main question/data type. This is because the data was sampled properly. I do belive that more participants would have been better, but there were enough for semi-reliable data. Furthermore, their results were not incredible or necesarily groudnbreaking, they showed that the two medications were not signifigantly differant in regards to their Lanza scores. However, it does favor slightly one group. Furthermore, they have no incentive, that I could find, to try and prove one of them to be better, or any loyalties. I also trust the WOMAC data they collected as well because the p-values were extremely low. Their discoverires did not show anything unexpected or drastic, so there is no real reason to discredit them. Furthermore, there were only 2 secondary test types, so they werent fishing for connections. However, the adverse events type has such a low amount of data points, I find it unreliable, and not signifigant of anything. I belive that their results overall are trustworthy, with the main and WOMAC results being extremely, and the ailments one inconclusive of anything major. 




### Publish or Perish Mentality

I do not belive the writers had this mentality or that it has affected this study. This is because there was nothing groundbreaking or surprising in the data. This mindset is usually used to see connections when there are none, but since these researchers did not find anything extreme, controversial, surprising, etc., I find it unlikely that this mentality affected anything. However, they are writing for a journal, so it is theoretically possible that they were looking to get published and it somehow affected the study, but as stated before, I think its extremly unlikely.
